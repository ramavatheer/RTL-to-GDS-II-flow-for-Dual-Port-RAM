This project involved implementing a complete RTL-to-GDSII flow for a Dual-Port RAM design using Cadence tools. The design was
described in RTL and synthesized using Cadence Genus, followed by floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and signoff using Cadence Innovus. The final layout was optimized for area, timing, and power, ensuring DRC and LVS compliance. This project
provided end-to-end exposure to VLSI physical design methodologies and EDA tool flows.
